# AI Touchpoint Specifications

## Smart Search Typeahead

### Problem Statement
Customers frequently abandon searches because our current system requires exact keyword matching. Users describe products using natural language that doesn't align with our product titles or SKU conventions, leading to missed sales opportunities and poor search experience.

### Happy Path User Flow
1. Customer begins typing in the main search bar
2. After a 200ms debounce period, the system captures the partial query
3. The AI analyzes the query for semantic meaning and shopping intent
4. Vector similarity search runs against the product catalog
5. Top 5 most relevant products are retrieved with confidence scores
6. Results are formatted to show product names, prices, and categories
7. Suggestions appear in the dropdown interface
8. User can either continue typing or select a suggestion
9. Selection redirects directly to the product page
10. The interaction is logged for continuous model improvement

### Grounding and Guardrails
We'll ground the AI in our existing product catalog of 10,000 SKUs. The retrieval scope is limited to product titles, categories, and key attributes. We set a maximum context window of 512 tokens to maintain low latency. The system will politely decline to answer queries outside our product domain by showing only product-related suggestions.

### Human-in-the-Loop Process
When the AI's confidence score drops below 70%, we'll escalate by showing a "View all results" link that performs a traditional keyword search. Our merchandising team will review low-confidence queries weekly with a 24-hour SLA to identify patterns and improve the model.

### Latency Budget Breakdown
We've allocated 50ms for initial query processing, 150ms for vector search operations, 50ms for result formatting, and 50ms for network overhead, totaling 300ms p95. We expect a 70% cache hit rate by storing common query patterns and their results.

### Error Handling and Fallbacks
If the AI service is unavailable, we'll immediately revert to our existing keyword-based search. For low-confidence results, we'll show popular products in relevant categories. Error states will display helpful messaging encouraging users to try different keywords.

### PII Handling Protocol
Search queries are processed without transmitting personally identifiable information. We anonymize all search data after 30 days and exclude personal data from model training datasets. No customer information leaves our application boundary.

### Success Metrics
- **Product Metric 1**: Search-to-product conversion rate (percentage of searches that lead to product page views)
- **Product Metric 2**: Time-to-first-result average reduction (seconds saved from search to product view)
- **Business Metric**: Incremental revenue from AI-assisted searches, measured via dedicated tracking parameters

### Feasibility Assessment
The product catalog is accessible via existing APIs, and we can implement vector search using cloud services like Pinecone. The next prototyping step involves testing with a sample of 100 products to validate relevance scoring against manual quality assessments.

## Support Assistant

### Problem Statement
Our support team spends significant time answering repetitive policy questions about returns, shipping, and account issues. This overwhelms agents and delays responses to complex customer issues that truly require human intervention.

### Happy Path User Flow
1. Customer clicks the "Help" button in site navigation
2. Chat interface opens with a friendly greeting and prompt
3. User types their question in natural language
4. System analyzes intent against our FAQ knowledge base
5. Most relevant answer is retrieved with source citations
6. Response is formatted for easy reading with bullet points
7. User receives instant answer with option to ask follow-ups
8. If unsatisfied, user can escalate to human agent
9. Entire conversation is logged for training purposes
10. Brief satisfaction survey appears after resolution

### Grounding and Guardrails
The assistant is grounded in our existing FAQ markdown files and policy documents. Retrieval is scoped to returns, shipping, pricing, and account management topics. We use a 2000-token context limit and explicitly refuse questions outside our documented policies with a polite redirect message.

### Human-in-the-Loop Process
Escalation triggers include explicit user requests for human help or confidence scores below 60%. The UI surfaces a "Contact agent" button that transfers conversation context. Support leads review escalated conversations within 15 minutes during business hours.

### Latency Budget Breakdown
The workflow allocates 200ms for intent classification, 400ms for document retrieval, 500ms for response generation, and 100ms for UI rendering, totaling 1200ms p95. We anticipate a 30% cache hit rate for frequently asked questions.

### Error Handling and Fallbacks
Service failures trigger an automatic fallback to showing relevant FAQ sections. If that fails, users see a contact form with context pre-filled. During system outages, a graceful degradation message directs users to our help center.

### PII Handling Protocol
We redact email addresses from all logs and mask order numbers in training data. Customer conversations are automatically deleted after 90 days, and no PII is used in model training or improvement cycles.

### Success Metrics
- **Product Metric 1**: First-contact resolution rate (percentage of questions solved without human escalation)
- **Product Metric 2**: Assistant satisfaction score collected via post-interaction surveys
- **Business Metric**: Weekly reduction in support ticket volume for handled question types

### Feasibility Assessment
All policy documents exist in well-structured markdown format, and we have API access to order status for verification queries. The next step involves creating embeddings for our knowledge base and testing with sample customer questions from recent support tickets.
